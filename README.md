A personal blog, website and portfolio repository. The website is designed and developed by [George Mathew](http://george-mathew.com). All fonts are served via [Typekit](http://typekit.com). Body copy is set in Minion Pro and headings are set in Proxima Nova or Minion Pro.

The website is built on [Siteleaf](http://siteleaf.com)'s CMS, using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) for task automation, [Sass/SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) for CSS preprocessing and [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid) for templating. The CSS architecture is built on a modular, OOCSS/BEM framework, [Inuit.css](http://inuitcss.com/), created by the brilliant [Harry Roberts](http://csswizardry.com/).

**Some to-dos**

* Refactor the SCSS files and clean up the organization a bit
* Deal with some naming issues in the sass files
* Refactor the SCSS to enlarge the copy and widths for resolutions higher than 1200px (not the most urgent, but would be nice to do)
